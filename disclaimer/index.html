        <h2 id="disclaimer" title="Disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Everything in <a href="/">The Pekka Kana 2 Library</a> (PK2Lib) is <strong
                    style="text-transform: uppercase;">totally free</strong> (this includes episode downloads, reviews,
                etc). We are a fan project and as a such, we <strong style="text-transform: uppercase;">will
                    never</strong> make any profit out of it!
            </li>
            <li>All submitted episodes/maps/resources that are approved and added to pk2lib are the original creation of
                their respective creators (the map maker(s) who created them). <strong>We assume</strong> that the
                map/episode/resource authors agree to release their works as/for free. <strong>We also assume</strong>
                that any derivative works based on these aforementioned creations <em>are allowed</em> <strong
                        style="text-transform: uppercase;">if</strong> proper credit to the original author(s) is given.
                Giving credit means including information about the original author and the original work in a text
                (.TXT) file added to the .ZIP package of the derivative work when you’re planning on submitting your
                derivative to pk2lib or elsewhere. To paraphrase, the thing that is needed to give credit to the
                original author, whose work you’ve modified and plan to share as a derivative work, is <em>to explicitly
                    state (write) the nickname (pseudonym) and/or real name of the original author</em>, along with <em>info
                    about the original work (if there is any)</em> and to include an URL/URI hyperlink to the original
                author’s webpage or to a webpage that hosts the original work. We also advise modifiers (authors of
                derivative works based on other’s original or modified work) to include information about themselves
                (like nickname and/or e-mail) and their derivative work in the same manner if they plan on submitting
                these derivative works of theirs to pk2lib, or redistributing them in some other way. It is also a very
                good idea for you to have multiple (preferably safe/secure) backups of your creations in case something
                happens that wipes everything (hopefully, there won’t be any such incidents…). This also goes for the
                pk2lib staff – we’ll try to make regular (weekly or monthly) backups of the whole contents of the pk2lib
                website in case we need them to restore stuff.
            </li>
            <li>All episode/map/resource reviews <strong>ARE</strong> the creation and personal opinion of their
                respective writers (i.e. the reviewer(s) who wrote them). Mistakes and inaccuracies <strong>ARE</strong>
                possible and will be fixed as soon as they come to our attention (if pointed out by readers like you).
                Slight changes to posts and/or pages are possible and should be done only in order to fix language
                mistakes (typos, punctuation, clarity of expression, etc.) or inaccuracies.
            </li>
            <li>The episode files, screenshots and other resources are hosted in 2 ways:
                <ol>
                    <li>on our Dropbox Public folder, and</li>
                    <li>on free file hosting services, such as MediaFire.com.</li>
                </ol>
                We are not affiliated with these websites in any way, we just make use of their generous free hosting
                services. The above means that downloading locally hosted files listed on pk2lib (from our EpisodeDB
                and/or ResDB) may sometimes be impossible (unavailable) due to maintenance offline times for our web
                hosting. Similarly, our mirror downloads of files at MediaFire.com and/or images on ImageShack.us may
                sometimes be unavailable due to these websites being offline, under maintenance or experiencing
                problems. <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">If you face such an offline time</span> that doesn’t
                permit you to download files listed on pk2lib, you could either:
                <ol>
                    <li>wait some hours in hope that the servers will be up and running by then, or</li>
                    <li>try to search for the target files using a search engine like Google (the Piste Gamez forums are
                        a great second stop, search those forums before/after googling, there’s a good chance that luck
                        may shine upon you there).
                    </li>
                </ol>
            <li>The <strong>PK2Lib</strong> is <strong>NOT</strong> to be held liable/responsible for <em>any and
                all</em> damage that may arise from the use (playing) of submitted PK2 episodes/maps <strong>OR</strong>
                from the following of tips or other types of instructions and advice mentioned in articles (posts and/or
                pages), graphic guides and episode reviews. We’re also not liable/responsible for damages arising from
                attempted modifications, i.e. misuse (or “abuse”), of maps/episodes, resources or official PK2 files.
            </li>
            <li>Some portions of this website use copyrighted in-game graphics from Pekka Kana 2, created and owned by
                Piste Gamez / Janne Kivilahti. These graphics and/or other types of resouces are used under a Fair Use
                policy and their purpose is to present the main topic of this website (which is Pekka Kana 2 stuff)
                via easily recognizable, distinctive official (or modified) PK2 images that players of PK2 know, love
                and relate to the game experience (gameplay) and design of the original PK2 game. The same policy is
                used for other content for informative (review) purposes. Such content includes custom user-created
                images (like screenshots, sprites, backgrounds, etc), sound and video materials, as well as description
                texts and screenshots from the old PK2 Mapstore. All of these materials are used in reviews of episodes,
                in posts, pages, comments and/or in guides and tutorials.
