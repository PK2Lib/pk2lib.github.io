                <ol>
                    <li>Everything in <a href="/">The Pekka Kana 2 Library</a> (PK2Lib) is <strong
                            style="text-transform: uppercase;">totally free</strong> (this includes episode downloads,
                        reviews,
                        etc). We are a fan project and as a such, we <strong style="text-transform: uppercase;">will
                            never</strong> make any profit out of it!
                    </li>
                    <li>All submitted episodes/maps/resources that are approved and added to pk2lib are the original
                        creation of
                        their respective creators (the map maker(s) who created them). <strong>We assume</strong> that
                        the
                        map/episode/resource authors agree to release their works as/for free. <strong>We also
                            assume</strong>
                        that any derivative works based on these aforementioned creations <em>are allowed</em> <strong
                                style="text-transform: uppercase;">if</strong> proper credit to the original author(s)
                        is given.
                        Giving credit means including information about the original author and the original work in a
                        text
                        (.TXT) file added to the .ZIP package of the derivative work when you’re planning on submitting
                        your
                        derivative to pk2lib or elsewhere. To paraphrase, the thing that is needed to give credit to the
                        original author, whose work you’ve modified and plan to share as a derivative work, is <em>to
                            explicitly
                            state (write) the nickname (pseudonym) and/or real name of the original author</em>, along
                        with <em>info
                            about the original work (if there is any)</em> and to include an URL/URI hyperlink to the
                        original
                        author’s webpage or to a webpage that hosts the original work. We also advise modifiers (authors
                        of
                        derivative works based on other’s original or modified work) to include information about
                        themselves
                        (like nickname and/or e-mail) and their derivative work in the same manner if they plan on
                        submitting
                        these derivative works of theirs to pk2lib, or redistributing them in some other way. It is also
                        a very
                        good idea for you to have multiple (preferably safe/secure) backups of your creations in case
                        something
                        happens that wipes everything (hopefully, there won’t be any such incidents…). This also goes
                        for the
                        pk2lib staff – we’ll try to make regular (weekly or monthly) backups of the whole contents of
                        the pk2lib
                        website in case we need them to restore stuff.
                    </li>
                    <li>All episode/map/resource reviews <strong>ARE</strong> the creation and personal opinion of their
                        respective writers (i.e. the reviewer(s) who wrote them). Mistakes and inaccuracies
                        <strong>ARE</strong>
                        possible and will be fixed as soon as they come to our attention (if pointed out by readers like
                        you).
                        Slight changes to posts and/or pages are possible and should be done only in order to fix
                        language
                        mistakes (typos, punctuation, clarity of expression, etc.) or inaccuracies.
                    </li>
                    <li>The episode files, screenshots and other resources are hosted in 2 ways:
                        <ol>
                            <li>on our Dropbox Public folder, and</li>
                            <li>on free file hosting services, such as MediaFire.com.</li>
                        </ol>
                        We are not affiliated with these websites in any way, we just make use of their generous free
                        hosting
                        services. The above means that downloading locally hosted files listed on pk2lib (from our
                        EpisodeDB
                        and/or ResDB) may sometimes be impossible (unavailable) due to maintenance offline times for our
                        web
                        hosting. Similarly, our mirror downloads of files at MediaFire.com and/or images on
                        ImageShack.us may
                        sometimes be unavailable due to these websites being offline, under maintenance or experiencing
                        problems. <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">If you face such an offline time</span> that
                        doesn’t
                        permit you to download files listed on pk2lib, you could either:
                        <ol>
                            <li>wait some hours in hope that the servers will be up and running by then, or</li>
                            <li>try to search for the target files using a search engine like Google (the Piste Gamez
                                forums are
                                a great second stop, search those forums before/after googling, there’s a good chance
                                that luck
                                may shine upon you there).
                            </li>

                    <li>The <strong>PK2Lib</strong> is <strong>NOT</strong> to be held liable/responsible for <em>any
                        and
                        all</em> damage that may arise from the use (playing) of submitted PK2 episodes/maps
                        <strong>OR</strong>
                        from the following of tips or other types of instructions and advice mentioned in articles

                        arising from
                        attempted modifications, i.e. misuse (or “abuse”), of maps/episodes, resources or official PK2
                        files.
